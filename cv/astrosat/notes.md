## Coding

### JavaScript Common Errors

* undefined | 0 | null | "undefined" | "null" 
* if (myVariable) {} // 0 doesnt pass - always use if (myVariable !== undefined) {}
* Use of "==" comparator instead of "===" comparator
* Mutating Variables / Arrays - trying to track where array/variable values have been changed
* Data Binding issues
* No central data store - no Immutability
* Css selector names clashes when using multiple libraries
* Variables name collision when using multiple libraries
* Numbers passed in as strings end up up being concatenated as strings 2.10 + 3.10 = 5.2  "2.10" + 3.10 = 2.103.10
* Confusion over what "this" refer to inside a class - function or class?
* In early object oriented design was declaring variables using this.prototype._myPrivateVariable instead of this._myPrivateVariable which meant the varisble for set for all objects
* javascript prototypal inheritance - clunky workaround - mostly solved by ES6
* Weakly typed - Not catching strings being passed in as numbers - leads to numbers being concatednated strings

### JQuery and Modular Javascript

### NPM | Grunt| Node

### ES6 | React | Redux

## Work Flow

### Visual Studio Issues

* Visual Studio builds - works on one computer not on another
* Forgetting to add new files to solution leading to broken builds
* Not full confidence in deployment
* Slow, clunky check in / out process - have to open VS to check out from TFS - takes too long
* Password confusion - having to contact HQ for new password too often
* Confusion over Microsoft accounts - personal vs work email
