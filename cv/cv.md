Interests
------

I've been a member of the Edinburgh Ski Club since 2003 and love to snowboard in both Scotland and The Alps.

I took up kitesurfing in 2005 (after hanging up my rugby boots). I was a founder member of the Fife & Edinburgh Kitesurf Club. I'm usually found at Longniddry or Gullane, with the occasional trip further afield to places such as Tiree, The Red Sea, Turkey and Tarifa.

I enjoy walking and finding new places around Edinburgh and during my lunch breaks can often be found rambling around Arthurs Seat. I also enjoy the occcasional trip to the highlands for both low and high level walks.

When not walking Im usually cycling. I commute by bike. I've mountain biked all over Scotland but still love to get back to Glentress whenever I can.
