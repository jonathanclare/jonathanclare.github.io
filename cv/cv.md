Interests
------
**Ski & Snowboarding**
Member of the Edinburgh Ski Club since 2003. Love to snowboard in both Scotland and The Alps.

**Kitesurfing**
Took up kitesurfing in 2005 (after hanging up my rugby boots). I was a founder member of the Fife & Edinburgh Kitesurf Club. I'm usually found at Longniddry or Gullane, with occasional trips to places such as Tiree, The Red Sea, Turkey and Tarifa.

**Cycling** 
I commute by bike. Have mountain biked all over Scotland but still love to get back to Glentress whenever I can.

**Hiking & Walking**
Enjoy walking around Edinburgh and often can be found on Arthurs Seat during my lunch breaks.
